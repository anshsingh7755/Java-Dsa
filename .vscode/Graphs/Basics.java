// A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (nodes) and edges.

//  properties
// => Weighted
// => Connected
// => Directed
// => Cyclic
// => Loop

// Adjacency matrix and graph 
// The Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array (matrix) where each cell on index (i,j) 
// stores information about the edge from vertex i to vertex j.

// Adjacency List Graph Representation??

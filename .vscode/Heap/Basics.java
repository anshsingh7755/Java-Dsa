// A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: 
// for every node, the value of its children is greater than or equal to its own value


// Max Heap: The root node contains the maximum value, and the values decrease as you move down the tree.
// A[Parent(i)] >= A[i]


// Min Heap: The root node contains the minimum value, and the values increase as you move down the tree.
// A[Parent(i)] <= A[i]

// Applications
// Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are retrieved based on their priority (maximum or minimum value).
// Heapsort is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort an array in ascending or descending order.
// Heaps are used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
